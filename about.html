            My name is John and living the simple life saved my life
          </h1>
          <p class="article__text">
            <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even
            appreciate any of it because there was too much.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a
            relationship.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article__subtitle">
            How I turned things around
          </h2>
          <p class="article__text">
            <strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the
            garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And
            it
            worked.
          </p>
          <h2 class="article__subtitle">
            Now I live the simple life
          </h2>
          <p class="article__text">
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more,
            and
            I have more free time to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="article__text">
            With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and
            how
            others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
